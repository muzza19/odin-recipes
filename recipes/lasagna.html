<h2>Description</h2>
<pre>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made by layering wide, flat sheets of pasta with fillings such as ragù (a
meat-based sauce), béchamel (white sauce), cheeses (like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan), and sometimes vegetables or
pesto.
The assembled dish is baked in the oven until the top is golden and bubbly, creating a rich, comforting meal.
